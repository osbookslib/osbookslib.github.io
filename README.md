## What is OSbookslib ?
OSbookslib is a public website that acts as a convenient "index" for all pdfs. It's essentially a list of crowdsourced resources all available in one place.

## Sounds cool, How do I get involved ? 
You can suggest resources and books by emailing the admin, bibliothekofficial@gmail.com. Please <b>link</b> mirrors to your resources if possible. Else, try to provid a valid ISBN number.
